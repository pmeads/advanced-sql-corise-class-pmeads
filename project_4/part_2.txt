There are a couple issues with the candidate's SQL

I like that the CTE's are named relatively well. However, I don't feel it is modularized 
enough. It is not easy to understand, especially as there are no comments. I feel like 
the candidate tried to do too much in the CTE's. Additionally, the last_order_date is 
taken from the top 3 orders, and that is not what was asked (the last_order_date from 
ALL urgent orders was requested). The results are off in that the order_numbers have 
duplicate orders in them. The Lineitem table has the part key in it so there was no 
reason to join in the part table. This may have accounted for the duplicates.  Definately 
joining this table contributed to the execution time added to the execution time 
unnecesarily.  More poor performance implications were created by adding order by's in 
the CTEs.
